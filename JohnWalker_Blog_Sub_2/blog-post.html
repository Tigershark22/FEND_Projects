          <p>One of the best parts of visiting a national park is the solitude.  Since parks tend to be remote it is important
            bring your own supplies.  It is also import to remember where everything goes.  I recommend taking a picture to 
            help yourself remember.</p>

          <p>Many of the national parks in the western United States are vast.  Indeed the magnitude of their 
            lakes and mountains is emense.  Its easy to lose yourself in the "bigness" of it all.  Make sure you don't 
            miss the small details like the variety of flowers.</p>

          <p>There are currently sixty-three national parks in the United States.  No doubt they all present many photo opportunities.  
            When looking for that perfect spot try to find a place that does not impede traffic on the trail and does not put you in 
            danger either.</p>

          <p>Most residents of Texas are familiar with Big Bend National Park which borders <strong>Mexico</strong>.  But Texas also boast one other national
            park which borders <strong>New Mexico</strong>, Guadalupe Mountains National Park; which lays claim to having the tallest peak in 
            Texas.</p>
